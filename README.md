# Langton-ant
A self implementation of the cellular automaton named the Langton-ant.

#### Inside function :

 * EtapeFourmiBD: Function to update the state of the ant and of the plate. The rule applied by this function is if the ant is on a white cell (equal	to 0) then this cell turn to black (equal to 1), the ant turn on herself 	at 90째 to the right and advance one square. Otherwise, if the ant is on a black cell, this on turn to white, the ant turn on herself at 90째 to the left and advance one square.
 
 * EtapeFourmiBG: Function to update the state of the ant and of the plate.	The rule applied by this function is if the ant is on a white cell (equal	to 0) then this cell turn to black (equal to 1), the ant turn on herself	at 90째 to the left and advance one square. Otherwise, if the ant is on a	black cell, this on turn to white, the ant turn on herself at 90째 to the right and advance one square.
 
 * Plot_state: Function to plot the sate of the plate and of the ant.
 
 * Plot_BW_rate: .
 
 * FourmiDeLangton: Function to create and make evolve a Langton ant model.
