# Langton-ant
A self implementation of the cellular automaton named the Langton-ant.

#### Inside function :

 * white_right_step: Function to update the state of the ant and of the plate. The rule applied by this function is if the ant is on a white cell (equal	to 0) then this cell turn to black (equal to 1), the ant turn on herself 	at 90째 to the right and advance one square. Otherwise, if the ant is on a black cell, this on turn to white, the ant turn on herself at 90째 to the left and advance one square.
 
 * white_left_step: Function to update the state of the ant and of the plate.	The rule applied by this function is if the ant is on a white cell (equal	to 0) then this cell turn to black (equal to 1), the ant turn on herself	at 90째 to the left and advance one square. Otherwise, if the ant is on a	black cell, this on turn to white, the ant turn on herself at 90째 to the right and advance one square.
 
 * plot_state: Function to plot the sate of the plate and of the ant.
 
 * plot_black_white_rate: Function to plot the evolution of the filling of the plate by cells equal	to 0 or to 1.
 
 * hist_visit_cells: Function to show the frenquentation of the cells of the plate.
 
 * hist_looks: Function to plot the distribution of the direction in which the ant have	looked during the evolution.
 
 * langton_ant: Function to create and make evolve a Langton ant model.
 
 ### Some exemple of the possibility:
 
 Some step plot with: langton_ant('white_right', 400, 15000, walk=1000)

 The 490 000-th iteration of: langton_ant('white_right', 400, 500000, trap=True, walk=10000)
 ![image1](TrappedLangtonAnt.png)

Final stage and the history of the proportion of white and black cell with: langton_ant('white_right', 250, 800000, trap=True, walk=400000)

2d histogram of the exploration of the cell with: langton_ant('white_right', 250, 800000, trap=True, walk=400000)

Distribution of the looks with: langton_ant('white_right', 250, 800000, trap=True, walk=400000)
![image4](looks.png)

Final stage for: langton_ant('white_right', 250, 100000, trap=True, fill='1', walk=100000), langton_ant('white_left', 250, 100000, trap=True, walk=100000), langton_ant('white_right', 250, 100000, trap=True, fill='rand', walk=100000)
